            <p>
                <strong>Rizz</strong> is Gen Z slang for charisma, charm, or the ability to attract someone romantically. It was named Oxford's Word of the Year in 2023, and the hashtag #rizz has billions of views on TikTok. When someone has "rizz," they have natural game – the ability to charm and attract others, especially in dating contexts.
