                <li><strong>Playful but respectful</strong> – Show interest without being pushy</li>
                <li><strong>Specific and personal</strong> – Reference something about them</li>
                <li><strong>Open-ended</strong> – Give them something to respond to</li>
                <li><strong>Confident but not arrogant</strong> – Show interest without being desperate</li>
                <li><strong>Appropriate timing</strong> – Don't send flirty texts at 3 AM</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">💡 Tips for Flirty Texting Success</h2>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">1. Match Their Energy</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Pay attention to how they respond. If they're playful, match that. If they're more reserved, dial it back. The key is reading the room (or in this case, the text thread).
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">2. Use Emojis Wisely</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Emojis can add playfulness and tone, but don't overdo it. A well-placed 😉 or 😊 can enhance a message, but too many can come across as immature.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">3. Build Gradually</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Don't go from zero to 100. Start with light flirting and gradually increase the intensity based on their responses. This builds comfort and shows you respect boundaries.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">4. Ask Questions</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Flirty texts work best when they give the other person something to respond to. Ask questions, make statements they can react to, or reference something specific.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">5. Be Genuine</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The best flirty texts feel authentic. Use these examples as inspiration, but make them your own. If a line doesn't feel like you, don't use it.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">❌ What NOT to Do</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                <li><strong>Don't be too sexual too soon</strong> – Build comfort first</li>
                <li><strong>Don't send multiple texts without a response</strong> – Give them space</li>
                <li><strong>Don't use generic pickup lines</strong> – Personalize your messages</li>
                <li><strong>Don't ignore their boundaries</strong> – If they're not responding well, back off</li>
                <li><strong>Don't overthink it</strong> – Sometimes simple works best</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">📱 Context Matters: When to Send Flirty Texts</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                <li><strong>After a good conversation</strong> – When you've already established rapport</li>
                <li><strong>During appropriate hours</strong> – Not too early or too late</li>
                <li><strong>When they're responsive</strong> – If they're engaging, it's a good time</li>
                <li><strong>Before a date</strong> – Build anticipation</li>
                <li><strong>After a date</strong> – Show continued interest</li>
            </ul>
