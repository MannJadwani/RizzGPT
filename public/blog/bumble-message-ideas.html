                On Bumble, women make the first move – but that doesn't mean you can't stand out when they message you! Here's how to craft the perfect response and keep the conversation going. Plus, message ideas for when you're the one reaching out (in same-gender matches or Bumble BFF).
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Understanding Bumble's Unique Dynamic</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Bumble is different from other dating apps because women initiate conversations. This means:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                <li>If you're a man matching with women, wait for her to message first</li>
                <li>Your response matters – make it count!</li>
                <li>In same-gender matches, either person can message first</li>
                <li>You have 24 hours to respond before the match expires</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">💬 How to Respond to Her First Message</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">When she messages you first, here's how to keep the momentum:</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">If She Says "Hey" or "Hi"</h3>
            <div class="space-y-2">
                <div class="message">"Hey! Thanks for reaching out. I noticed you're into [interest from profile]. What got you into that?"</div>
                <div class="message">"Hi! I'm glad you messaged. Your [photo/interest] caught my attention. Tell me more!"</div>
                <div class="message">"Hey there! I see you like [hobby]. I've been wanting to try that – any recommendations?"</div>
            </div>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">If She Asks a Question</h3>
            <div class="space-y-2">
                <div class="message">Answer her question, then ask a follow-up: "Great question! [Your answer]. What about you – [related question]?"</div>
                <div class="message">"I love that question! [Answer]. It reminds me of [related story]. Have you experienced something similar?"</div>
            </div>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">If She References Your Profile</h3>
            <div class="space-y-2">
                <div class="message">"I'm so glad you noticed that! [Expand on it]. What drew you to that part of my profile?"</div>
                <div class="message">"You're the first person to mention that! [Story about it]. What's your experience with [related topic]?"</div>
            </div>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">🔥 Best Bumble Message Ideas (For Same-Gender or When You Can Message First)</h2>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Profile-Based Messages</h3>
            <div class="space-y-2">
                <div class="message">"I saw you're into [interest]. I'm obsessed with that too! What's your favorite [related thing]?"</div>
                <div class="message">"Your [photo/interest] is amazing. I'd love to hear the story behind it!"</div>
                <div class="message">"You mentioned [detail from bio]. That's so interesting! How did you get into that?"</div>
            </div>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Question-Based Messages</h3>
            <div class="space-y-2">
                <div class="message">"Quick question: what's the best thing that happened to you this week?"</div>
                <div class="message">"If you could travel anywhere right now, where would you go and why?"</div>
                <div class="message">"What's something you're weirdly passionate about?"</div>
                <div class="message">"What's your go-to comfort food when you need a pick-me-up?"</div>
                <div class="message">"What's the most spontaneous thing you've done recently?"</div>
            </div>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Playful Messages</h3>
            <div class="space-y-2">
                <div class="message">"I'm not usually this forward, but you seem really interesting. What's your story?"</div>
                <div class="message">"You look like someone I'd want to know better. Prove me right?"</div>
                <div class="message">"I have a feeling we'd get along. Want to test that theory?"</div>
            </div>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">💡 Bumble-Specific Tips</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                <li><strong>Respond quickly</strong> – You have 24 hours, but responding sooner shows interest</li>
                <li><strong>Reference her profile</strong> – Show you actually read it</li>
                <li><strong>Ask open-ended questions</strong> – Give her something to respond to</li>
                <li><strong>Keep it light</strong> – Bumble is generally more relationship-focused, but still keep it fun</li>
                <li><strong>Use the 24-hour extension wisely</strong> – You get one free extension per day</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">❌ Common Bumble Mistakes</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                <li>Responding with just "hey" or "thanks" – too generic</li>
                <li>Being too sexual in early messages</li>
                <li>Not asking questions back</li>
                <li>Letting the match expire without responding</li>
                <li>Copy-pasting the same response to everyone</li>
            </ul>
