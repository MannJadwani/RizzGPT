            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What Makes a Great Tinder Opener?</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                <li><strong>Personalized</strong> – Reference something from their profile</li>
                <li><strong>Question-based</strong> – Ask something that's easy to answer</li>
                <li><strong>Light and fun</strong> – Keep it playful, not too serious</li>
                <li><strong>Unique</strong> – Avoid generic "hey" or "what's up"</li>
                <li><strong>Confident but not creepy</strong> – Show interest without being pushy</li>
            </ul>
