            <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-6">
                One of RizzGPT's most powerful features is its screenshot analyzer. Ever received a message on a dating app and didn't know how to respond? Just take a screenshot, upload it to RizzGPT, and get instant suggestions for the perfect reply. But how does it actually work? Let's break down the technology behind this game-changing feature.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What is OCR Technology?</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition. It's a technology that can "read" text from images, converting visual text into digital text that computers can understand and process. RizzGPT uses advanced OCR to read the text from your dating app screenshots, understand the conversation context, and suggest appropriate replies.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Think of it like having someone read your phone screen and help you craft a response – except it's AI, and it's instant.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">How RizzGPT's Screenshot Analyzer Works</h2>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Step 1: Image Upload</h3>
                <p>You take a screenshot of your dating app conversation and upload it to RizzGPT. The image is securely processed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Step 2: OCR Text Extraction</h3>
                <p>RizzGPT's OCR engine scans the image and extracts all visible text, including messages, timestamps, and profile information.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Step 3: Context Analysis</h3>
                <p>The AI analyzes the extracted text to understand:
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
                        <li>Who said what in the conversation</li>
                        <li>The tone and mood of the messages</li>
                        <li>The topic being discussed</li>
                        <li>What kind of response would be appropriate</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Step 4: Reply Generation</h3>
                <p>Based on the context, RizzGPT generates multiple reply suggestions that are:
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
                        <li>Contextually appropriate</li>
                        <li>Matching the conversation tone</li>
                        <li>Engaging and likely to get a response</li>
                        <li>Personalized to the situation</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Screenshot Analyzer vs. Copy-Paste</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
                <strong>Copy-Paste:</strong> Requires manually selecting and copying text, which can be tedious and error-prone.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                <strong>Screenshot Analyzer:</strong> Just take a picture and upload. Much faster and easier, especially on mobile.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Screenshot Analyzer vs. Generic Lines</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
                <strong>Generic Lines:</strong> One-size-fits-all messages that don't consider context.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                <strong>Screenshot Analyzer:</strong> Context-aware suggestions based on the actual conversation, making them much more likely to get a response.
